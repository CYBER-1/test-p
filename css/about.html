                    <h1>Hey! I’m Mykola, I like to make cool stuff.</h1>
                    <p>More specifically, I’m a designer who codes.  With a background in graphic design and business I bring a blend of creativity and data-driven solutions.</br>
                    </br>
                    Since I was a kid I enjoyed Legos because it opened an opportunity to innovate either by creating futuristic cars or spaceships. By the age of 7 I was studying physics and math and was utterly amazed by the sheer amount of unique architecture Europe had to my disposal. From a beautiful Salamanca because of the golden glow of its sandstone buildings to Prague and Dresden with its myriad of Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque structures. I was lucky enough to visit many countries and those experiences translated into my designs.</br>
                    Being raised in Ukraine had some challenges for an artsy person like me and as a result I’ve had to put my love for art on hold and transition into a more stable business degree.</br>
                    </br>
                    Little did I know that life had different plans for me and when I was 19 years old, I came to United States.
                    With $1000 in my pocket, a job and a drive to be the best I can be I set out to learn everything I can in design. From simple meetups with designers to amazing books and courses, all of this built me up and as a result I was able to land my first design job at a silk printing company. With time my desire to push myself to learn new things brought me into owning a similar business myself. Even though it was fun and creative there’s a limit to what you can do in printing industry. My desire to learn more overwhelmed me once more. So to no surprise I decided to improve on my skills and that’s how I came across an article on UX design and immediately knew that was it. The idea of creating interactive user centric products that solve people’s problems seemed interesting and allowed me to use data to innovate. Over the years I’ve learned that you need to do what you love even if you need to take calculated risks. So I’ve said goodbye to my 10K clients and passed the torch to another eager to learn entrepreneur.</br>
                    It might seem like a long journey to find your passion, however, I’m utterly grateful to all the experiences, connections or just fun brainstorming sessions I had to do in order to arrive here.</p>
